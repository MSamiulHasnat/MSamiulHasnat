# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, it's SAMIUL here
### An enthusiast Competitive Programmer 

In last few months, i have learnt a lot, how to work with people, the most important thing that i have learned is how to achieve something by sheer determination, hardwork and honesty. I am eager to learn more about marketing. But, i don't know what i can do for you. Just want to be the person who can solve problems in such a way that will be helpful for the people that are having problems. To me this is not only an achievement but also a path to take.
